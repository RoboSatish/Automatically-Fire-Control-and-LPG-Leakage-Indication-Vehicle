# Automatically-Fire-Control-and-LPG-Leakage-Indication-Vehicle
Abstract 

The Gas leakage is one of the big problems with industrial sector, residential milieu and gas functioning vehicles like CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) buses, cars etc. One of the contraceptive methods to stop accidents associated with the gas leakage is to install a gas leakage detection device at vulnerable places. The system detects the leakage of the LPG or CNG using a gas sensor and uses alert and control system. When the concentration of LPG in air exceeds a certain level, the sensor senses the gas leakage and the output of the sensor goes LOW. The detection is done by the gas sensor, through the microcontroller the LED and buzzer with water pump spraying water on fuel tank are turned ON simultaneously. Another one flame sensor is installed for sensing the flame or fire in the vehicle they can sense and provide signal to controller for water spraying.
